### About Me

- Hello! I'm a Computer Science bachelor, Master's student of Applier Computing and Software Engineer. Dedicated to continuously enhancing code quality and optimizing software performance. I'm currently developing a research about how to use I.A to identify botnets on a network.

- I am currently learning [Go](https://go.dev/).

- You can shoot me an [email](mailto:isadfrn@gmail.com) and I'll try to respond as soon as I can.

- I use my GitHub with my students, my work, as a sandbox for learning and also for my side projects. So there is a lot of repositories here, with multiples programming languages and spoken languages. I try to make it the most organized as possible, but if you want to see the projects as a portfolio, please check my [personal page](https://isadfrn.dev/) for a detailed view.
